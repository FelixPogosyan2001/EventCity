<h2>What is the idea of EventCity ? </h2>
<p>
Application is intended to add events that will be available to all users. Events can be added only by authorized users, and unauthorized users have the right to view.
</p>
<h3> How does it work ?</h3> 
<p>
Before you add an event, you need to specify a price to use it. 
Already after the addition, users can book those events that interest them.

<p>
All booked events will be displaying to the user, both as a list and as a diagram that shows how many cheap, normal and expensive events have been booked.
